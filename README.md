Mozilla's Django LocalLibrary tutorial. All code credited to Mozilla. Thanks for the great tutorial (it is both clear and complete) https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Introduction

Purpose

Start learning Django and more Python by working through an example, in this case a toy library website.

Observations

1. Templating is templating. There are a lot of conceptual similarities between Blazor, which I have used before, and Django.
2. Django provides a ton of functionality out of the box that is not in Blazor! A lot of the coding feels like configuration more than anything.
3. Django is its own world - There is a lot to learn and become familiar with. It will take a couple projects to really internalize the Django way.
4. I appreciate the peace of mind that comes with a number of security issues and best practices being available or enforced through the framework.
5. This is a much more fun way to work on Python than the standard learn Python tutorials I have done.
6. I really, really appreciate a good tutorial. I tried a couple of others, but Mozilla's is thorough, well-explained and the project works. That is not as common as one would think.
7. Starting out in a new framework and/or language is overwhelming. I have a project in mind I would like to do in Django for the experience, but there were a few times I caught myself thinking it would be so much easier if I stuck with what I already know in other languages. Of course, that way lies stagnation.
8. Dynamic typing is still not my favourite thing. I am not the biggest fan of it in JavaScript and PHP, and I do not like it much in Python. I much prefer static typing and the compiler yelling at me. I just know I am going to have difficult to figure bugs because of type confusion down the road that I just could not make in a statically typed language. Before anyone yells at me, I know about the research showing no differences in defect rates between projects in dynamically and statically typed languages. That blows my mind.
9. I get the advice of only biting off a little at a time. Learn Python. Do a bunch of small projects. Then learn a framework. Etc. But. That takes forever and doing the same kinds of exercises over and over again in different languages is mind-numbing. I would rather struggle (a lot) learning the language and something a little more tangible. Even if it's discouraging at times.
10. My first language was C++. My second was Java. My third was C#. I am not at professional level in any of them yet, and am most comfortable in C#. I have done some very small stuff with JavaScript, PHP, Lisp, Objective-C, Swift and Ruby. I get why people like Python. It feels approachable. The syntax is pretty simple (though I don't get the aversion to brackets and braces or the worry about loss of productivity - I type faster than I think and design, it's not the braces that slow me down). But I am not at all bit by the Python bug yet. I don't love the language. Nothing about it gets me going the way you would think by all the hype around the language. I'm hoping that by the time I finish a couple of my own projects in Python I will have a much better feel and aesthetic appreciation for Python code. But it seems like just another language at its base. I like Django, but that's not about the language, that's about the incredible amount of work the Django project has put into their project.
11. Frameworks like Django blow my mind. The sheer amount of work that has gone into it. I would love to have something like Django for Blazor. Maybe I should start it and nurse it for the next 15 years (as long as Microsoft doesn't kill Blazor!). I can absolutely see the value and importance and power to make a language that libraries and frameworks bring.
